Welcome to the course of Big Data Systems.  Scalable big
data systems are a central part of modern data science.  This course
will cover topics including design and use of parallel dataflow
systems (MapReduce/Hadoop and Spark), scalable and parallel Python
analytics frameworks, machine learning systems (Ray), and cloud data
systems (cloud storage, large ML infrastructure). A major
