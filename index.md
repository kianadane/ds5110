## Overview

Welcome to the course of Big Data Systems.  Scalable big
data systems are a central part of modern data science.  This course
will cover topics including design and use of parallel dataflow
systems (MapReduce/Hadoop and Spark), scalable and parallel Python
analytics frameworks, machine learning systems (Ray), and cloud data
systems (cloud storage, large ML infrastructure). A major
component of this course is hands-on programming using scalable
analytics tools and cloud resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or
Google Cloud.


## Lecture Info

* Instructor: [Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io)
* Meeting time: TuTh 2:00 pm - 3:15pm
* Location: Data Science Building Room 305


## Topics (tentative)

* Basic of computer and data systems, principles of parallel and distributed computing
* Google's big data infrastructures (MapReduce, Google File System)
* Apache Spark
* Parallel Python analytics
* Machine learning systems (Ray, LLM)
* Cloud computing
* Serverless computing
* Large-scale cloud storage systems (Amazon Dynamo, AWS S3/DynamoDB)
* AI/ML platforms (Hugging Face)


## Prerequisite

* All students should be comfortable with programming in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, Go, C/C++. This is a strong requirement as DS 5110/CS5501 features hands-on programming.
	* That said, being comfortable with Python is **strongly recommended** as all the programming assignments will be done using Python. Having some experience in Java, Go, C/C++ is a big plus!
